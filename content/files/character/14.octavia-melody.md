# Pony Infomation

Octavia Melody, or simply Octavia, is a background Earth pony who appears in the episodes The Best Night Ever, Sweet and Elite, Inspiration Manifestation, and Equestria Games and in the IDW comics. She has a dark gray mane and tail. Her coat color is that of gray. She is unnamed in the series, but she is named in merchandise. She has a dark gray mane and tail, a light gray coat and light purple eyes, and wears a pink bow-tie with a white collar. She shares her eye design with Rarity, the spa ponies, and several background ponies, except for the iris. Her cutie mark is a violet treble clef, though the cello is most often notated with a bass clef. The cello is also normally played sitting down, although she plays standing, like a double bass. If it were a double bass, her cutie mark would still be conflicting because double bass is also usually written for in bass clef.
