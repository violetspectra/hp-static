# File Description

This file's purpose is to transform the listener into the Indiana Jones-esque pegasus known as Daring Do. The "core file" uses binaural beats, background music, and ambience to enhance the presented environment and bring the listener into a state of trance. Derivatives of the core file are also available for those interested in such. It is highly recommended that you use the reset support file, if you are actively listening to another character file and want to transition. EKP (Emotional Kernel Panic) is a very real danger that should be taken seriously.

Side effects of listening to this file include, but are not limited to:

- Change in personality, attitude, and a gravitation towards solitude
- Acquiring new interests such as writing stories
- Feeling phantom limbs, such as a tail or pony ears
- Altered perception of your species
- Identifying with the opposite gender
