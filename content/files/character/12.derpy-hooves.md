# File Description

This file's purpose is to transform the listener into Ponyville's resident mailmare Derpy Hooves. The "core file" features the creative contributions of isochronic tones artist FlutterHi, and creates an environment in which the listener is brought into a state of trance. Derivatives of the core file are also available for those interested in such. It is highly recommended that you use the reset support file, found here, if you are actively listening to another character file and want to transition. EKP (Emotional Kernel Panic) is a very real danger that should be taken seriously.

Side effects of listening to this file include, but are not limited to:

- Change in personality, speech, and attitude
- Acquiring new interests
- Feeling phantom limbs, such as a tail or pony ears
- Altered perception of your species
- Identifying with the opposite gender
